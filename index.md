When we say bioinformatics, we know there is coding, softwares and biology involved. But if one is interested in learning the same where do we start? Should we start with the biology or the coding part? If biology, which part should I start with? If I go with coding where do you think I should start? I am a student pursuing my masters in bioinformatics trying to provide answers to these beginner-level questions and certain ideas as to where one can learn BIOINFORMATICS in a simple and easy way.
